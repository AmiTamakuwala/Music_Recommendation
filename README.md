We use the KKBOX dataset to build a music recommendation system in this project. 
This music recommendation app project will walk you through some Machine 
learning techniques that one can apply to recommend songs to users based on their 
listening patterns. To predict the chance of a user listening to a piece of music 
repetitively after the first observable listening event within a particular time.
